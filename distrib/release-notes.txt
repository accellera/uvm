What's Changed

Release 1.2 contains enhancements and fixes to errata.

UVM 1.2 fixes the following enhancements and issues reported under the
Mantis bug-tracking system. Issues affecting the reference
documentation (API changes or semantic changes) are preceded with an
asterisk (*).

For detailed information on a specific issue, refer to the Mantis

the Mantis id.


In increasing Mantis numerical order:

Mantis 3741: Added command-line functionality to setting default_sequence

Mantis 4091: Added missing top-level block name to uvm_reg_file::get_fullname()

Mantis 4425: BUSY flag now cleared when register model is reset.

Mantis 4513: Added user-defined memory allocation policy to uvm_vreg::allocat()

Mantis 4516: Proper prioritization of default sequences

Mantis 4517: Added phase transition callbacks

(*) Mantis 4518: Classes extended from uvm_object now require an
explicit constructor with a string-type name argument.  This
functionality was optionally enabled in prior versions by defining the
`UVM_OBJECT_MUST_HAVE_CONSTRUCTOR symbol (Mantis 3770).  This
functionality is now the default. Should the obsolete functionality be
required, define the `UVM_OBJECT_DO_NOT_NEED_CONSTRUCTOR symbol.
